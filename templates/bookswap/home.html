<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Hi! Welcome to the <i>Kzoo LitHub</i>. This website was created the <i>Kalamazoo College Computer Science Club.</i></p>
<h3>Why should you use LitHub?</h3>
<p>The LitHub website can help you save money. When compared to websites online and bookstores, LitHub helps to buy books for less and sell for more. Here's how:</p>
<p>If you bought a Calculus book for $100 and later sold it (without damaging it), you will probably get far less than $100 in return. This is because there are additional costs in buying and selling a book through a bookstore or website. First, the company needs to make money and keeps a portion of the total sales. Second, the book needs to be packaged and shipped. Since you probably intend to sell any book you buy, you will incur these costs whether it's the buyer or seller that takes the burden of these costs. As a result, you pay more than the book's "value" when you buy it and make less when you sell it.
<h3>How LitHub works</h3>
<p>If books are bought <b>and</b> sold by the people who actually use the books. In true free-market style, there are no extra fees or costs. You buy and sell at the same going rate for that book in that condition. This website essentially helps you network and find people willing to sell the books you want and buy the books you want to sell.</p>
<p>The Kzoo LitHub isn't guaranteed to be cheaper and doesn't guarantee that you will find a seller or buyer, since there are only a limited number of people who use this website. Comparing prices is always a good idea.</p>
