THIS FILE IS A DRAFT AND HAS NOT BE TESTED THOROUGHLY.

Installing LitHub on a development server (for development):

  1. Copy lithub_config-example.py to lithub_config.py
  2. Edit the LITHUB_ROOT variable so that it points to the directory in which your project exists
  3. Run `python manage.py syncdb`. Note, however, that if the version of python you hope to use is different from the default python, you should use that instead.
  4. Run the development server using `python manage.py runserver`

Installing LitHub in production:

  1. Copy lithub_config-example.py to lithub_config.py
  2. Edit the LITHUB_ROOT variable so that it points to the directory in which your project exists
  3. Reading, understanding and editing settings.py would be good idea at this point. You may not want to use the default settings. Ensure DEBUG is set to False.
  4. Run `python manage.py syncdb`. 
  5. Edit the STATIC_ROOT variable if you want to and run `python manage.py collectstatic`.
  6. From urls.py remove the following from the last line: " + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)"
  7. Make your server point requests for STATIC_URL (default: '/static/') to STATIC_ROOT.
  8. Use your preferred method of Django Deployment (mod_wsgi is easy and safe).
